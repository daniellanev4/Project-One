        <h1>Quality Plus Caterers</h1>
        <p>This is a Family run business, my aunt Maureen and uncle Billy have had this business
          for many years and have been very successful. I have worked for them since 2017 before High school.
          I started off prepping in the kitchen with my aunt for catering jobs and later on I became the dishwasher
          at parties. Now I am a waitress/caterer for private parties and functions where I only work on weekends.

            <h1>Hollister Co.</h1>
            <p>This job was my first real job and my first time working in retail.
            I will say working in retail is not for me. I am better off in the food business.
            I worked in the Freehold Raceway Mall last year for about 6 months until I put in my 2 weeks.
            I was working in the dressing room, greeting customers on the floor and in the back for unpacking.

                <p>I have been certified as a Lifeguard on April 11th 2021. It was at Centrastate wellness center.
                  Afterwards, I Lifeguarded for private parties as a side job with catering. However, now I am in the process
                  of getting a job at the Freehold YMCA.
