<!--Bio-->
<h1> Why Daniella? </h1>
<p> my mother was an illegal Colombian immigrant when she met my father.
  Their are two reasons why she named me Daniella;
  Number 1: she has an Uncle named Daniel who was her idle and who she adored
  Number 2: my grandmother said the name Daniella one day and my mother fell in love with the way
  my "nanny" said it.
  My mom said she wanted me to have an American name and a bit unique which is why she added two L's instead of one.
